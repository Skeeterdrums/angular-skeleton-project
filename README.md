# angular-skeleton-project
A simple angular skeleton project with unit testing, code coverage, and webpack integrated. I believe this is based on https://github.com/AngularClass/angular-starter when it was built for Angular 2.

## usage
Build the project:
* npm install

Test the project (and watch for changes):
* npm test
* npm run test:watch

Test with code coverage:
* npm run coverage

Package the project:
* npm run build

Run the project:
* npm start
